# Where to Access Lidar Data

Lidar data is becoming increasingly available, especially in the United States.

[Open Topography](https://opentopography.org)

Open Topography is a great starting point for finding lidar data. Educational access is available, however, 
file sizes and downloads are limited. The website can generate raster derivatives based on available point
cloud data.

[USGS](https://apps.nationalmap.gov/downloader)

The most recent Lidar data for the U.S. is available in an interactive map through the USGS.

[GatorEye](http://www.speclab.org/gatoreye.html)

Drone-based lidar data is available through the University of Florida's GatorEye Unmanned Flying Laboratory.
The spatial coverage is limited due to the drone-based system that can only target well-defined research areas.
