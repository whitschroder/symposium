# Resilience and Heritage
**Universidad de Cuenca**  
**Summer 2025**

Friday, June 6  
8:30 am -- 12:00 pm  
Venue: Facultad de Arquitectura y Urbanismo, Universidad de Cuenca

# Objective

The track on Resilience and Heritage delves into the symbiotic relationship between built heritage and resilience in the face of disasters and dynamic environmental challenges. This track aims to explore how preserving and integrating heritage into urban planning and disaster management strategies can foster more resilient communities. Heritage, encompassing historic structures, monuments, cultural landscapes, and traditional architectural practices, not only carries immense cultural and historical significance but also plays a pivotal role in enhancing community resilience. The Resilience and Heritage workshop focuses on documenting changing cultural landscapes through several technologies, including lidar and multispectral imagery. In this workshop, we will focus on how to access publicly available global datasets and analyze them using cloud-based and machine learning approaches in Google Earth Engine. These approaches are designed to be more accessible to researchers who do not have access to high resolution datasets or powerful computers.

# Target Audience

This workshop is aimed at students interested in documenting and preserving cultural heritage and land use through environmental change and disasters.
