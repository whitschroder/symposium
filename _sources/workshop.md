# Workshop Activity

In this activity, we will use the following datasets:

[University of Florida](https://whitschroder.github.io/uf)

[Cedar Key](https://whitschroder.github.io/cedarkey)  

[Shell Mound](https://whitschroder.github.io/shellmound)  

[Rosewood](https://whitschroder.github.io/rosewood)

# Learning the Potree Interface

Select one of the above point clouds.

1. Practice navigating around the point cloud. Scroll down to the Navigation section and use the Fly Control
and Helicopter Control to zoom and pan around. Adjust the speed as necessary. Double-click to zoom and center
to a specific point.

2. Scroll down to Scene, and under Point Clouds select index.

3. Scroll down further to Attribute, and select the different options.

4. Select the classification attribute and explore the point cloud.

5. Under Filters adjust the Classification options. Choose a symbology that you prefer.

6. Are there any issues with the Classification?

7. Turn off all Classification options except for ground.

8. Scroll back up to Attribute and select elevation. Choose a symbology and adjust the Elevation range
for better viewing of subtle elevation differences.

9. What area has the highest elevation? What area has the lowest elevation? Use the Point Measurement tool
to get exact values.

10. Once you are familiar with the point cloud and interface, address the questions specific to your point
cloud.

# Cedar Key

1. Turn on (show) all of the Classification layers.

2. Find the historic Island Hotel (use Google Maps and then identify where the building is in the point cloud).
Be sure to use Street View also.

3. Can you identify any risks associated with this location? Consider elevation relative to sea level, 
trees, power lines, impermeable surfaces, etc.

4. Using the various Measurement tools, what are the dimensions of the building (width, length, height,
area, etc.)?

5. Change the Attribute to intensity. Intensity refers to the strength of the lidar return after hitting
different materials. Is the roof of the Island Hotel darker or brighter than other structures in the area?
(Consider adjusting the slider Range for more contrast.) What might the intensity of the roof tell you about
its material and any hazards during a storm?

6. What is missing from the lidar data that could be helpful in assessing this property?

7. Experiment with the visualization options, and create your own. What does your visualization reveal?

# Shell Mound

1. Turn on (show) all of the Clasification layers.

2. Are there any buildings visible in the point cloud? If so, where?

3. Navigate to any building locations on Google Maps. What risks are associated with this location? Consider
elevation relative to sea level, trees, power lines, impermeable surfaces, etc. Be sure to use Street View
also.

4. Using the various Measurement tools, what are the dimensions of the buildings (width, length, height,
area, etc.)?

5. Navigate to Shell Mound (check on Google Maps). Find the location in the point cloud.

6. Turn off all Classification options except for ground. Change the Attribute to elevation. Adjust the
symbology to match your preferred settings. Keep your visualization to present to the workshop later.

7. Is the Shell Mound visible? This is an important Native American archaeological site. Can you find
additional information online?

8. What risks are associated with the Shell Mound's location?

9. Explore the point cloud further. Are there any other possible Shell Mounds in the surrounding area?

10. What is missing from the lidar data that could be helpful in assessing this property?

# Rosewood

1. Turn on (show) all of the Classification layers.

2. Find the John Wright house (use Google Maps and then identify where the building is in the point cloud).
Be sure to use Street View also. (Hint: the house is near the Rosewood Historical Marker.)

3. Can you identify any risks associated with this location? Consider elevation relative to sea level, 
trees, power lines, impermeable surfaces, etc.

4. Using the various Measurement tools, what are the dimensions of the building (width, length, height,
area, etc.)?

5. Change the Attribute to intensity. Intensity refers to the strength of the lidar return after hitting
different materials. Is the roof of the John Wright house darker or brighter than other structures in the area?
(Consider adjusting the slider Range for more contrast.) What might the intensity of the roof tell you about
its material and any hazards during a storm?

6. What is missing from the lidar data that could be helpful in assessing this property?
