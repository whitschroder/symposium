## Google Earth Pro

Download Google Earth Pro for desktop [here](https://www.google.com/earth/about/versions/#download-pro). We will not be using Google Earth Pro in this workshop, but it provides the highest resolution free imagery.

## Planet Imagery

Planet imagery is based on commercial satellites, but educational users can request access to imagery based on a monthly quota, available at <https://www.planet.com>. Planet provides the highest resolution multispectral imagery at low or no cost. This imagery can be linked to Google Earth Engine by following these [instructions](https://university.planet.com/planet-data-delivery-to-google-earth-engine-gee/2194209/scorm/1u1vnzzovej22).
